# Homemade Ice Cream

Almost anything goes when you want to do ice cream (or vegan replacements for it): Use a mixer to mix the ingredients, store in freezer, wait for it to be frozen, take it out, wait until it can be mixed again and mix. Repeat a couple of times to avoid crystals to form.

Some ideas:

- Banana and Avocado: 3 bananas for each avocado
- Banana and strawberries: 4 strawberries for each banana. You can add some water to get more bang for the buck
- Nutella: 1/2 of milk for each of Nutella
