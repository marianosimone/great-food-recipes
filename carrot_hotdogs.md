# Carrot Hot Dogs

## Ingredients

- Large carrots, peeled, with the ends cut off
- Soy sauce
- Water

### Optionals

- Liquid smoke
- Beer
- Clove garlic, minced
- Dried ginger
- Black pepper
- Onion powder
- Hot dog buns
- Hot dog toppings

## Directions

1. Boil carrots until fork tender but not mushy. Run them under cold water to stop the cooking process.
2. While the carrots are cooking, whisk together the soy sauce, water and optional seasonings (garlic, beer, ginger, ppepper, etc.)
3. Put the carrots with the marinade in an air-tight container and place in the refrigerator for at least 24 hours.
4. Spray a medium skillet with olive oil cooking spray, turn the heat to medium and place the carrots and about 1/2 cup of the marinade into the skillet. Cook until they get a nice crispy and seasoned coating on them from the marinade.
5. Eat as hot dogs (or however you like!)
