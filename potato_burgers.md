# Potato Burgers

## Ingredients

- Potatoes
- Bread crumbs
- Eggs (about 1 for every big potato)
- Olive oil
- Garlic
- Leeks, onions, green onions, or whatever you'd like to add to them
- Cheese (parmigiano is great, but any would do)
- Spices to taste (salt, pepper, cumin, red pepper)

## Preparation

- Make mashed potatoes! (err on the side of chunkiness)
- Meanwhile, brown the onions/garlic/leeks to taste
- Mix the potatoes with the browned veggies, eggs, cheese and spices
- Make "hamburgers" with the mixture and bread them
- Put them in in the oven to brown them (there's nothing to cook anymore!)
